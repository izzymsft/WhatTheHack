# What The Hack - Integrating OpenAI on Microsoft Azure

## Introduction

This introductory hackathon will provide participants with hands-on experience on how to integrate the Azure Open AI offering as well as the upstream Open AI service with Microsoft Azure platform services.

## Learning Objectives

The objective of the hackathon is to demonstrate different strategies for integrating the Azure Open AI product as well as the upstream Open AI offering with Azure Platform products including but not limited to Azure Cognitive Services, Partner offerings on Microsoft and Open-Source projects.

### Exit Competencies: 
The participants will learn how to:
- Select different architectures to implement Open AI solutions on Azure based on the scenarios
- Understand when to use Open AI products and when to leverage Cognitive Services or other solutions
- Provision and configure Azure Open AI resources
- Secure access to Azure Open AI Resources
- Integrate Azure Private Virtual Networks with Azure Open AI
- Perform capacity planning and quota enforcement for Open AI resources
- Manage availability, business continuity and disaster recovery.
- Implement solutions for batch and near real-time use cases.
