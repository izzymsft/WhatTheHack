# Challenge 02 - OpenAI Models & Capabilities

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-03.md)


## Pre-requisites

* Access to Azure subscription, create notebook in Azure Machine Learning Studio
* Get access to Azure OpenAI resources
* Deploy your own AOAI models in AOAI portal
* Apply for Quota Increase

## Introduction

As LLMs grow in popularity and use around the world, the need to manage and monitor their outputs becomes increasingly important. In this challenge, you will learn how to evaluate the Azure OpenAI models and how to apply them in different scenarios.

## Description
Model deployment for the challenge:
- Deploy the following models in your Azure OpenAI resource. 
  - `gpt-35-turbo`
  - `text-ada-001`
  - `text-babbage-001`
  - `text-curie-001`
  - `text-davinci-003`
  - `text-embedding-ada-002`
- Add required credentials of Azure resources in the ``.env`` file

Questions you should be able to answer by the end of this challenge:
- What are the capacities of each Azure OpenAI model?
- How to select the right model for your application?
- What model would you select to summarize promptsï¼Ÿ
- What model would you select to generate new names?
- How to retrieve embeddings?
