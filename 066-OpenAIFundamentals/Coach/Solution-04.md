[< Previous Solution](./Solution-02.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-04.md)

## Notes & Guidance

There are three important parts to Challenge-04. The students will go through each of these notebooks. 
- `CH-04-A-RAG_for_structured_data.ipynb`
- `CH-04-B-RAG_for_unstructured_data.ipynb`

Challenge-04 has no required tasks. There is not an accompanying Solution Notebook for this Challenge.

The Challenge-04 Notebook consists of code cells for students to run. The purpose is to expose students to developing best practices from observing existing tools and implementation, both 1st- and 3rd-party. The cells display example outputs of what the students should see.
