## Notes & Guidance

There are three important parts to Challenge-03. The students will go through each of these notebooks. 
- `CH-03-A-Grounding.ipynb`
- `CH-03-B-Chunking.ipynb`
- `CH-03-C-Embeddings.ipynb`

Each of the notebooks above are filled with code cells. They will run through these cells as they go through the exercises. In the Solutions folder, you will see the same notebooks but with the solutions. The cells display example outputs of what the students should see. Use this as a reference for the answers, although some outputs may vary slightly on the students' side.
