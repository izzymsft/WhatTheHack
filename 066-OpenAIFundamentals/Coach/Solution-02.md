[< Previous Solution](./Solution-01.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-03.md)

## Notes & Guidance
There are 2 sections to Challenge-02: Model Comparison Overview, and Implementation. The students will go through each section of this notebook:
- `CH-02-ModelComparison.ipynb`
  
The notebook above is filled with code cells. Students will run through these cells as they go through the exercises. In the Solutions folder, you will see the same notebook but with the solutions. The cells display example outputs of what the students should see. Use this as a reference for the answers, although some outputs may vary slightly on the students' side.
