[< Previous Solution](./Solution-01.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-03.md)

## Notes & Guidance

This challenge is OPTIONAL.

There are 2 sections to Challenge-02: Model Comparison Overview, and Implementation. The students will go through each section of this notebook:
- `CH-02-ModelComparison.ipynb`
  
The notebook above is filled with code cells. Students will run through these cells as they go through the exercises. In the Solutions folder, you will see the same notebook but with the solutions. The cells display example outputs of what the students should see. Use this as a reference for the answers, although some outputs may vary slightly on the students' side. 

- Students can take CH1 as a reference for prompt engineering
- The model comparison chart does not have a specific correct answer. Students can put what they find in the chart.
- Coaches should ask students which model they would choose for each challenge and the reasons of choosing the model.
