    "This notebook will walk you through a use case to understand the concept of grounding. Grounding is used when you want the model to return reliable answers to a given question. Often times, the GPT models will need additional context to provide a response that does not hallucinate. There are a couple of methods to go about grounding. In this scenario, we will focus mainly on basic grounding within the prompt. In Challenge 3 and Challenge 4, you will see other applications of grounding by using an external knowledge base.\n",

As you do your research, you get stuck on picking between an individual or family plan.

    "\n",
    "# Deductible plans: With a deductible plan, your monthly premium is lower, but you’ll need to pay the full charges for most covered services until you reach a set amount known as your deductible.

Depending on your plan, some services, like office visits or prescriptions, may be available at a copay or coinsurance before you reach your deductible. \\\n",

You’ll get to choose how you get care, by taking full advantage of our many no-cost virtual care options — while having access to in-person primary care whenever you need it. \\\n",

With this plan, you can set up a health savings account (HSA) to pay for health costs like copays, coinsurance, and deductible payments. And you won’t pay Federal income taxes on the money in this account. You can use your HSA anytime to pay for care, including some services that may not be covered by your plan, such as eyeglasses or adult dental. And if you have money left in your HSA at the end of the year, it will roll over for you to use the next year. \\\n",
